         - Sent original author, Abigail, two emails and a CPAN ticket
           over the last 11 months without response so I'm submitting
           this update which I put together in 02/2005; this is itself
           probably already a bit out of date.
         - Tagged as dev release in case of transition problems.
         - Updated with codes added since last release.
         - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code
         - Most of the changes are countries that formerly didn't have
           3-letter codes; 12 new ones.
         - Updated dist with module-builder. Kept all original
           material but reorganized POD a bit and added information.
         - Modernized test script with Test::More; it's testing the
           same things as 1.4 was plus a couple new adjuncts.
         - Added synopsis.t.

       - Removed INIT{} from initializing code, as the INIT{} isn't
         run when doing 'require'.
